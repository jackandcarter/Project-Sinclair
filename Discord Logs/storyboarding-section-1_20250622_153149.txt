[2024-05-15 16:58:17] RxDrStocks: Overview shot of Olympus. Words come across screen.  Many years ago, groups of specialized angels lost their way and revealed themselves to humans. The humans worshipped these angels as deities: Greeks, Romans, Norse, and so many others. An unknown phenomenon caused the specialized angels to believe these falsities. They became the beings the humans believed them to be.   By the time, they came to their senses it was too late. The rift between them and their angelic brethren was created. A rift not easy to repair. That is until the unexpected would happen. God mysteriously sealed himself within Heaven without any explanation. Souls could still pass through, but the angels were barred entry.   To combat the growing forces of Lucifer's demon army, Heaven angels and the fallen specialized angels would come to an understanding. For without balance, what would become of the Earth and its mortals?  Thus, a truce was formed. Heaven's army allowed the specialized angels refuge in the dimension between Heaven and Earth. They would name this land after the fallen city of the Olympians, Olympus. Led by the Olympians, the specialized angels would bring their children to bolster the ranks of their army.   Their strength was enough to hold back the armies of Hell, and a stalemate was formed. Hell even grew quiet. Did they stop their plans for conquest? No, I don't think so. I believe it is only a matter of time before they strike once again.  My name is K. For now, I send my record keepers out to scour the world to document our history. Only by understanding our past can we hope to overcome the future.  This is the story of a group of demigods who constantly shifted the course of world events. I cannot say that they will be the ones to stop all of destruction, but I can hope. This is the start of the group known as The Holy Knights.
[2024-05-15 19:03:35] RxDrStocks: The above could flash to show pictures of the gods, angels, lucifer's forces as relevant.
[2024-05-15 19:22:04] RxDrStocks: Scene changes to the classroom. Classroom is fairly old looking. Old desks and chalkboard. Elijah is lecturing. Many of the students appear bored. Catherine is intently paying attention.
[2024-05-16 21:44:01] RxDrStocks: After dialogues that I will put later into script, Catherine and characters walk out of classroom into school hallway
[2024-05-16 21:48:19] RxDrStocks: Catherine and Ko talk to alivia in hallway. After dialogue, player can control Catherine. Player can explore school if desired, but not too much will be going on right now. Player leaves school when ready. past school gate and out into the road. follows road into Olympus.
[2024-05-16 21:49:15] RxDrStocks: At this point, not all of Olympus has to be open. The player can walk past the shops if the player wants, but they will be closed for now.
[2024-05-16 21:58:55] RxDrStocks: Player controls Catherine to the Clock tower that also has a fountain courtyard in front of it. That is where Tutorial fight takes place. Catherine versus Richard.
[2024-05-16 23:52:50] RxDrStocks: After clocktower fight, a scene transition with some words I will put in script later. Catherine will now wake up in her mansion. More of Olympus will open up, and maybe even some of the lands beyond. Might have some side quests that can be done here and there.
[2024-05-17 18:33:18] RxDrStocks: The player will be able to rest at Catherine's house to recover health.  Ko will be a party member at this point and if possible Alivia will be in her "advisor" role
[2024-05-17 20:44:10] RxDrStocks: For the player to move on with the story, they will eventually need to "go to class" cutscene will play with Elijah giving a lesson. Samson will barge in and interrupt class. Door can fly across the room from being kicked if possible. Paean follows Samson in. They talk about war simulator
[2024-05-17 20:47:18] RxDrStocks: Catherine tries to find more teammates from people in room. Alivia offers suggestions. In the book, this happened over a span of a day. However, I think we can spread out the recruiting over the course of a few "days". They will find Mavis at the Academy gate. Player has control over character again. The following day, Mavis will be allowed to help out the party.  Then, to move the story forward again. Player will eventually have to go to "class" again.
[2024-05-17 20:48:13] RxDrStocks: After class, Alivia will mention another lead. This will lead to the player going to the roof to meet with Zell to move the story forward. after discussion, Catherine falls asleep on the roof. Upon waking up, another discussion with Zell then Zell will be available as a member.
[2024-05-17 20:53:11] RxDrStocks: Zell and Catherine meet up with Alivia and Ko at Hephaestus Cafe
[2024-05-18 14:47:19] RxDrStocks: Zell leaves the H-cafe first, and the rest leave for school after. During class there is a cutscene with Zell swapping to Catherine, Ko, and Alivia's class. Elijah pulls him in on a rope tied to a cloud he's sleeping on.
[2024-05-18 14:49:11] RxDrStocks: After class, group goes to Samson's office to apply for the War Simulator. Office is described in https://discord.com/channels/1231373428179865734/1238869122171928608/1239304218473402460
[2024-05-18 14:57:28] RxDrStocks: Samson is lounging with sunglasses on when the group enters. Cutscene. Then, samson floats a book to Catherine for them to sign in their team name. Team discusses the name. Eventually decides. The War Simulator will take place in three days, and the player will be free to explore Olympus, the lands beyond, and do side quests during this time.   I know in the book I don't show off Zell's abilities until the war simulator, but I'm fine with us showcasing Zell early to let the player get a feel for the character. He might have only a few paint abilities to start off with though. Simple ones.
[2024-05-18 15:41:24] RxDrStocks: During the days, the player can also optionally attend lectures that can buff stats slightly.(?) One lecture per day. (?) If we want to do this, I can make some small extra lectures materials. This doesn't end the day. The days end when Catherine sleeps at her house.
[2024-05-18 15:50:37] RxDrStocks: Regardless, after the days pass, the day of the War Simulator event comes, and Catherine will go to the building that houses the War Simulator Beta at some point to continue the story.
[2024-05-18 16:06:03] RxDrStocks: Cutscene in waiting room of war simulator building. Explaining rules of game etc. Then groups move into the main room. war simulator building is described https://discord.com/channels/1231373428179865734/1238869122171928608/1241421242003623986
[2024-05-18 19:12:32] RxDrStocks: Eventually, it is Catherine's groups turn to stand on the large square in the room, and they are transported into the war simulator.
[2024-05-18 22:51:40] RxDrStocks: Cue screen cut to Ares and Dionysus in a recording studio talking about the game
[2024-05-18 22:56:43] RxDrStocks: Screen cut back to Catherine and the others appearing in the war simulator. barely visible box is around them until the game starts.
[2024-05-18 22:59:18] RxDrStocks: Mavis will pick up flag and the dirt around it with her water(The water came from water bottles they carried in.) and carry around using her water. Ko, Alivia and Mavis will go one way using Mavis's water to fly.
[2024-05-18 23:00:39] RxDrStocks: Catherine and Zell will fly on Zell's cloud on a different path.
[2024-05-18 23:01:00] RxDrStocks: We will cover part of Catherine and Zell's side of things first
[2024-05-18 23:01:33] RxDrStocks: Catherine and Zell will not have access to Alivia's advisor abilities
[2024-05-20 19:30:37] RxDrStocks: Small cutscene cuts back to Ares and Dionysus before team splits up. After they talk, the almost invisible box fades, and the team splits
[2024-05-20 19:45:06] RxDrStocks: Capture the Flag rules.
[2024-05-20 20:03:17] RxDrStocks: Capture the Flag rules.
[2024-05-20 20:53:38] RxDrStocks: After the team splits up, Zell and Catherine go through an area fighting mobs. After the area, a cutscene plays with Zell and Catherine on one of Zell's painted clouds. They find a team guarding a flag. and that static battle will play.
[2024-05-24 18:19:45] RxDrStocks: After the two static fights https://discord.com/channels/1231373428179865734/1240051766171664505/1242873858663387217 , there will be a cutscene, and then, things will swap gears to Ko, Mavis, and Alivia.
[2024-05-24 18:38:52] RxDrStocks: Another cutscene will play before the player will be able to control the party consisting of Ko, Mavis, and Alivia, in her unplayable advisor position. They'll be carrying the flag and the ground around the flag using Mavis's water. Then, the player will be able to move the characters on their side of the battlefield. In the background we could show a giant golden buddha, or other paint spells from Zell since Catherine and Zell would be fighting on the other side of the battlefield  They'll fight one regular demigod team before Saint Clarice. So, regular demigod team, random area, Saint Clarice fight.
[2024-05-24 19:07:02] RxDrStocks: After going through however many random sections we do, a cutscene will play, and they will come across a character that I vaguely mentioned in the Catherine book. Her name is Saint Clarice. She will have four demigod mobs with her that will be dressed in white and can be called Clarice's Attendants. Will give the details of this encounter in boss fight specifics
[2024-06-01 16:51:04] RxDrStocks: After the defeat of Saint Clarice, we will see a cutscene of some sort, and switch back to Catherine and Zell's side of things
[2024-06-01 16:56:20] RxDrStocks: Catherine and Zell will go through another random encounter section. After that, there will be a cutscene of two demigod groups fighting each other. Naomi will be the last one left standing. Zell and Catherine split up, and Catherine faces Naomi alone.
[2024-06-02 14:53:03] RxDrStocks: Fight ends after Naomi's health drops to 20%. Cutscene of Zell with the stolen flag. He picks Catherine up on his cloud, and they get away.
[2024-06-02 15:04:44] RxDrStocks: Catherine and Zell will see Mavis and Ko hangind around a field of flames. They decide to meet up with them. Will go through a random area on the way.
[2024-06-02 15:22:37] RxDrStocks: After that, cutscene on the group planning. Now, the party will switch around some. I will re-write this slightly for the game.
[2024-06-02 15:24:29] RxDrStocks: Alivia will call this a two pronged fight to ensure their victory. Zell and Alivia in advisor mode will go off on their own. While Catherine, Ko, and Mavis will fight Richard.
[2024-06-02 15:37:39] RxDrStocks: We'll start with Zell and Alivia. Small random section before next static fight
[2024-06-02 15:39:22] RxDrStocks: All random enemies will be pretty weak since it's just Zell.
[2024-06-02 15:41:07] RxDrStocks: for the static events with Zell, Alivia will probably have some pre determined buffs for Zell.
[2024-06-09 14:41:54] RxDrStocks: They will come up on two teams fighting each other. The team defending their flag has Carol, the satyress, guarding it. The other team will consist of Richard's cronies. Some of those will be fought first. They can even be called something like Richard's cronies or teammates etc. Nothing too special about them. Can be standard demigod mob types. Zell will have buffs given by alivia at the start of this fight and the next.
[2024-06-09 14:43:42] RxDrStocks: After this fight, Zell will be healed to full by potions from Alivia. Next is a fight against Carol and the two teammates she has leftover from the skirmish against Richard's teammates
[2024-06-09 14:58:01] RxDrStocks: will describe this static fight in boss fight specifics
[2024-06-10 20:31:08] RxDrStocks: Cutscene before swapping over to Catherine, Ko, and Mavis against Richard
[2024-06-16 15:46:05] RxDrStocks: As described in boss https://discord.com/channels/1231373428179865734/1240676070416449629/1249365702473683025 the fight against richard will end when he reaches about half health. A cutscene after the fight is also described there.  After this cutscene, richard and Catherine are back in the main simulator building. They watch the end of the match with Mavis capturing the flag, and the other demigods are pulled from the simulation.
[2024-06-16 15:47:38] RxDrStocks: Catherine and her group will be pulled into a meeting in another room in the war simulator building by Elijah. Paean, Athena, Samson, and Elijah will evaluate them on their performance.
[2024-06-16 15:49:42] RxDrStocks: This will also be where Catherine's group is informed of their upcoming field trip to a base
[2024-06-16 15:52:41] RxDrStocks: After this meeting, the player can control Catherine freely, do side missions etc, but will need to go to the Hephaestus Cafe to move the story along.   Cutscene of party at H-Cafe.  During the time there. It will begin to storm. Lightning flashes, and Catherine will see an old woman out the window of the cafe.
[2024-06-16 15:55:08] RxDrStocks: Catherine investigates. As soon as the player exits the H-Cafe. There is a cutscene. She sees a golden moon with a white ring around it. She steps out of the cafe and falls into darkness. Strings of darkness wrap around her and pull her through the dark until she is in the abode of the fates.
[2024-06-16 15:59:46] RxDrStocks: The abode of the fates. Catherine is being held up in the air in a room by the string. Now, there is a white floor under her. The string wrapped around Catherine travels to three women who are standing in front of her. The three women are the fates, who will be described in characters.  String continuously travels from Clotho's spindle to Catherine. leaves Catherine's body to Lachesis who observes the string. Then back to catherine. Leaves Catherine from another section of her body to finally end up at Atropos who is pulling the strong and holding really large scissors.
[2024-06-16 16:00:50] RxDrStocks: On either side of this room there are countless women at spinning wheels creating threads of life into the darkness that surrounds the room.
[2024-06-16 16:08:14] RxDrStocks: Fun fact: The reason there are so many women in this room at spinning wheels is the other women are equivalents of fate sisters from other religions.  I don't specifically say that in my books, but maybe I will in the lore of the game?
[2024-06-16 16:13:21] RxDrStocks: After the meeting, Catherine will wake up back at the H-cafe party.   After the party, the next day will start and the player will be able to freely control the group and do side stuff and what not. Naomi will officially join the party at this point. Maybe the arena will even be open.    The player will eventually have to go to the school and talk to Elijah to transition to the next section. The Base field trip. The player will not be able to return to Olympus until the field trip is over, and we should provide a warning.
