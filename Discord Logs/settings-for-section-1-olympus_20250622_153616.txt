[2024-05-11 15:09:48] RxDrStocks: Beginning is a school setting with a slight militaristic theme. I would like there to be a symbol to represent the Olympus army. I've always described them as having one, but never gave it much thought on what it looks like. I always just called it the Olympus insignia. Maybe an O with a lightning bolt running through it? Open to ideas on this.  The insignia has some concept work now https://discord.com/channels/1231373428179865734/1238375389840150538/1238976600557486161
[2024-05-11 15:16:36] RxDrStocks: First section is the intro to the game/tutorial. World movement, etc. after opening classroom scene, Catherine will walk out of the classroom. Through a school hallway. To the school gate. Through a street of Olympus. On the street of Olympus, Catherine could pass through some shops. The shops may be closed for the purpose of the tutorial. Maybe the shopkeepers are getting set up? Anyways, further down the street is the entrance to the clock tower where Richard is waiting for Catherine. We see Richard jump from the Clock Tower. When he reaches Catherine, Battle sequence starts.
[2024-05-11 15:22:22] RxDrStocks: In the tutorial battle, we will have an item called Water Bottle. This will be a required move to introduce items. Catherine will throw it at Richard and weaken him for the fight. Could also introduce elements in the fight sequences called Action Events. For instance, in this scenerio, there is a fountain. After dealing enough damage, Catherine is able to throw him into the fountain weakening his fire again. Just an idea for now.
[2024-05-11 15:27:30] RxDrStocks: Ultimate moves will not be introduced until war simulator and Zell hits his inspiration.
[2024-05-11 15:38:08] RxDrStocks: For the purposes of this being a game, it is likely I will come up for extra content than what was in the book for them to stay in areas longer, so that we fully utilize resources. I may fully revamp the rules of the capture the flag game as well to make it make more sense gameplay wise.
[2024-05-11 15:38:13] RxDrStocks: 
[2024-05-11 16:34:45] RxDrStocks: First section is the intro to the game/
[2024-05-11 20:46:30] RxDrStocks: Olympus is a city with golden roads stretching across it. Most of the residents live in extravagant mansions. The closer you get to the gate that connects to Earth, the more modern the buildings appear. So, the area around where the academy would be, would probably have more buildings with columns and such.  Entertainers are known to line the streets of Olympus and beings are flying around a lot. There would be vehicles in Olympus as well.
[2024-05-11 20:48:41] RxDrStocks: There would need to be a location called the Hephaestus Cafe. It could be more modern in design as Hephaestus is always up to date with the times being the inventor that he is.
[2024-05-11 20:50:46] Blink: cool
[2024-05-11 20:50:48] Blink: love it
[2024-05-11 21:03:21] RxDrStocks: Item shop 1.  We'll have a potion shop that sells products made from Paean, Asclepius, and Hecate. I know what her name will be, but I need to search for it. She will be the name I gave Audrey's mentor, Ellen. So, this girl will be a daughter of Hecate, so a young witch looking woman. Can just be a stall next to the road not far from the H cafe. Doesn't have to have an inside. Potions and ingredients can be decorations of the shop
[2024-05-11 21:36:44] RxDrStocks: Another location would be the courthouse of Olympus. Where the court resides. Tall columned building. Staircase leading up with large blocks on either side of the staircase. those large blocks are actually larger steps for taller beings like Hashira. Two guards at the doors.
[2024-05-11 21:38:57] RxDrStocks: Item shop 2 for weapons and armor. Actually, this shop could be built into the Hephastus Cafe. Since it would probably be a child of hephastus or hephastus himself selling the weapons/armor.
[2024-05-11 21:41:43] RxDrStocks: An accident in Paean's lab can cause wild magical beasts to be released in the school. plus an enocunter with some demigods can happen asking catherine if she wants to spar. This could lead to random encounters within the school for fighting/leveling up before the war simulator.
[2024-05-11 21:47:21] RxDrStocks: In the academy, you won't get a game over screen for fights. you will just respawn at some part of the school instead. We could have someone, Elijah?, swoop in to save Catherine. So, maybe she spawns at the classroom?
[2024-05-12 14:40:31] RxDrStocks: Inside of the Hephaestus Cafe would be a restaurant with tons of TV monitors lining the walls. The monitors show various sports from both Earth and Olympus. Hephaestus isn't always working in there, but for the sake of this game he can be. Also, will have a chef hat and apron when in there.
[2024-05-12 14:41:43] RxDrStocks: The weapon store located at the Hephaestus cafe can be a stall-like connected to the outside of the building by a road
[2024-05-12 14:43:24] RxDrStocks: Could have a sign saying H Cafe or Hephaestus Cafe in red in cursive
[2024-05-12 19:52:30] RxDrStocks: Samson the angel's office looks like a beach. Sand all over the ground and ocean water further out. The door in is basically like moving to a new location all together. He has a lounge chair and table with a drink next to it. There is a desk in the "Room" with sea shells scattered about. Two Drill swords in the room stuck in the sand close to Samson's lounge chair
[2024-05-12 19:53:57] RxDrStocks: The rooftop of the school where Catherine will talk to Zell. The city of Olympus can be seen from here. Flying beings, tall mansions. Maybe the sign to the Hephaestus cafe can be seen from here? Zell's canvases are scattered about as he's been working on the roof.
[2024-05-14 00:26:49] Snow Hey Oh: Are there houses scattered throughout Olympus, or is there more of a residential area?
[2024-05-14 00:42:39] RxDrStocks: Olympus
[2024-05-14 19:33:31] RxDrStocks: Catherine's house: Ko and Catherine both live here after Catherine found him on the streets of Olympus and offered him a place to stay  Very luxurious mansion. More on the modern side. Catherine's family could have been considered very influential on Olympus. Her grandfather was a business tycoon, but her mother died when Catherine was young, and her aunt had to take on the family business by herself. Since then, her family has lost much of it's power, so while her house is fancy, it does not have like butlers or anything like that.
[2024-05-15 19:56:37] RxDrStocks: Item shop 1.  We'll have a potion shop
[2024-05-18 16:04:48] RxDrStocks: War simulator building. First room is a normal waiting room. Another room is basically themed like a laser tag room. Darker room. Colorful lights. Large Square square that glows in multiple colors in center of the room. Words "War Simulator Beta Version" written across it.
[2024-05-18 16:45:13] RxDrStocks: Instead of having a stall outside the H-cafe. The weapons store can be next door to the cafe. Will call it Haphazard Helstien's H-armory.(? on the name). The place will be run by a couple. Amy and Hank Helstien. Yes, these are the parents of Brooke and Austin Helstien from book 1 and 2. Kids aren't born yet, so they won't be present. These are new characters, so I don't have any specifics with thier design. All i do know is Amy is the crafter and Hank has fire powers to help with the forge. Amy is a daughter of Hephaestus and Hank is a son of Hestia.
[2024-05-18 19:29:59] RxDrStocks: The virtual world of The War Simulator: For the purposes of the capture the flag event, the participants are spread in a large circle. In the circle there is forests, grass plains, and a large river that flows through it. Nothing too wild or crazy. Can have explosions or other attacks being shown in the background from the other teams fighting. As we approach the end of the game, Richard's area around his flag is a field of flames.  We will split the party into two here, and I will cover more material than I did in the book.
[2024-05-21 14:49:06] RxDrStocks: 20 teams of 5 are in the war simulator, but it's not like those have to be shown. The background could show some other flags far off. Attacks in the background like i mentioned before, and sections in the background being burned or frozen from attacks, etc.
[2024-05-24 19:17:45] RxDrStocks: Could show some attacks from zell in the background while playing as Ko and Mavis. and some water attacks in the backgroun while playing as Zell and Catherine since those two teams will be split and on opposite sides during the war simulator
