[2024-06-30 15:26:54] RxDrStocks: This section will begin with the base field trip located in Dúrnir’s Pass and last until... I feel it is too long.
[2024-08-30 17:23:40] RxDrStocks: Dúrnir’s Pass is a large base located at the bottom of Mount Kerling in Ireland. The base was made by an unknown race, but repurposed by Olympus. Think imposing impenetrable Dwarven architecture in design.   In my books, they only stayed a night before the demons attacked. That won't be the case in the game. They will get to explore a little around the base and do a few missions for Ferris's lieutenant.
[2024-09-03 18:39:15] RxDrStocks: Cutscene of Demigods flying on Pegasi to base. Catherine and her group are on Zell's clouds. Elijah and Paean are with the group on Pegasi.  Mavis is not present on the base mission unless we do the difficulty accessibility thing we talked about.
[2024-09-03 18:42:04] RxDrStocks: Group enters the courtyard of the base. Cutscene of Cathrine wondering about base's statue.
[2024-09-03 18:51:40] RxDrStocks: Player is then in Catherine and Alivia's room at the base.  Player will have contol over the character again at this point.
[2024-09-03 18:54:22] RxDrStocks: Party is just Catherine, and she will talk to Zell and Ko out in the hall. They will rejoin party.  Then, she'll find Alivia and Naomi a little further down. They are examining some of the base's design. Talking to them will have them rejoin.
[2024-09-03 19:01:39] RxDrStocks: The Player has to move to the Base's commander center to move the story to the next point. Cutscene with General Ferris and Elijah.  Ferris will suggest they go see his lieutenant. (Thinking of making this Punk Critical Kaisen Reich)
[2024-09-04 21:22:17] RxDrStocks: Lieutenant Reich will send Richard's group and Catherine's group to check on some patrols outside of the base.  Richard's group isn't controllable or anything. Just saying for story purposes.  Outside of the base let's have two paths. Right path goes to a small town. (need to research cities around mount kerling.) Left path goes to the mountain cave.  They will leave towards the town to check on the patrols.
[2024-09-04 21:22:50] RxDrStocks: Halfway through one of the zones, a cutscene will play out of some demigods yelling out for help.
[2024-09-04 21:25:54] RxDrStocks: The patrol is being attacked by a group of Hellhounds, and Catherine's team helps out.
[2024-09-04 21:29:30] RxDrStocks: After the fight, a cutscene occurs where Reich shows up. He didn't actually think they'd end up having to fight anything, but he approves of them helping his patrol. Reich hits one of his people with his bat for not being able to take care of themselves.
[2024-09-04 21:29:55] RxDrStocks: Reich also tells Catherine's group they can do a few other jobs for him if they want aka side missions. Some of the side missions will lead to the little town and the town will also have a few side missions.
[2024-09-06 19:25:43] RxDrStocks: Can rest a night to progress the story. I didn't do this in the book, but I think we can allow them to see the forge ahead of time. Ferris and Reich will give a talk about the forge and the base. After, Ferris will let Kai take over. Maybe fight some base officers (or Kai himself?) as training or something. Mid-sort of boss fight.  After, they are free to do some side missions, or Kai will also say that Ferris will also see them again as well. That will move forward the story. Cutscene back at the command center. After that, Cutscene between Naomi and Catherine which leads to them going to the roof. The next day will start. Cutscene as sirens goes off, and everyone goes to the base's command room.
[2024-09-13 19:28:42] RxDrStocks: I'm not really sure how we will do what comes next. This fight between ||Paean and Beelzebub|| is quite the doozy. Still, if we do a cutscene on it, I can edit in the info later. For now, I will work on the fights the holy knights specifically do.
[2024-09-13 19:43:25] RxDrStocks: They meet up with their class and Elijah, Paean, and Ferris in the Base's command room. Elijah and Ferris head out to confront Wrath and his forces at the nearby town. Paean stays to watch over the demigods. After some talking, eventually the base gives a warning that communications has been cut off. Then, an unknown disgusting sounding voice, Gluation's voice, sounds out. A gate from Hell rises from the ground right outside of the base. The large metal gate is destroyed right after by Beelzebub, his army of Daemons, Lust, and Lily.   When The Holy Knights spring to action, Alivia and Zell will not be around. I don't cover too much of what they do in the book, but perhaps I will in game?
[2024-09-26 14:13:36] RxDrStocks: Cutscene between the new demon invaders talking and then a fight between ||Paean and Beelzebub.||
[2024-09-26 14:48:47] RxDrStocks: Catherine, Richard, Ko, and Naomi join the battle after. Static fight Bollux and Lust versus Holy knights and Richard begins. Fight starts off with Lust and "Lily". At the beginning, Bollux in lizard form crawls from "lily" and transforms into it's dragon form.  This static fight WILL NOT be one that the player can win more info on the fight will be put in boss fight specifics. https://discord.com/channels/1231373428179865734/1240676070416449629/1288883261069725779
[2024-09-26 15:35:50] RxDrStocks: After the fight, a few things will happen. Richard will explode in flames which will help him escape Lust's seductive smell.  Naomi has wrapped one of Paean's surgical cloths lying around the battle field around her mouth and nose. Catherine also touches the statue of Hashira in the courtyard and hears a whisper from it. "Re..lease me..." She touches that statue after dodging Lust's whip probably.  Ko will be forced to fight Catherine and the others.  This will lead to Part 2 of the static fight. https://discord.com/channels/1231373428179865734/1240676070416449629/1288903515091107952
[2024-09-26 17:31:06] RxDrStocks: After part 2 ends, there will be a cutscene. Bollux and Richard will fly off to continue fighting. Naomi intercepts Lust. Ko and Catherine will continue fighting. Catherine is backed back into the Hashira statue again where it speaks to her once more.   Catherine goads Ko into doing a full charged punch. Catherine focuses very hard on dodging right before the impact and awakens to her light powers at the same time. She dodges so hard she travels across the courtyard into a wall just as Ko's punch connects to the status and releases Hashira.  after a little bit more of a cutscene we begin Part 3 Boss fight Lust. Hashira will join in for this fight.
[2024-09-26 18:25:18] RxDrStocks: Oh, right, Hashira's name is Pillar for now
[2024-09-26 18:34:36] RxDrStocks: Lily disappears from all sight sometime during all of this
[2025-01-23 19:58:21] RxDrStocks: Bollux is brought to the ground by Hashira(pillar) throwing his halberd at him at the end of the fight. Hashira carries a crushed Lust in his hand. Catherine rides on Hashira's shoulder, and "Ko" asks to come along.
[2025-01-23 20:07:47] RxDrStocks: When they reach the collapsed Bollux, Hashira drops a defeated Lust to the ground. Catherine begins to interrogate her while Lust tries to bargain for her life.
[2025-01-23 21:11:00] RxDrStocks: Catherine ||is then stabbed from behind by a metal bo staff. "Ko" turns out to be Lily... or lilith shapeshifted. || Catherine escapes by channeling her light powers into a light step. But the light step speeds her straight into a mountain and crushes her back from the impact
[2025-03-18 16:07:33] RxDrStocks: A man shrouded in a brown cloak walks up to and offers to save a dying Catherine. When Catherine accepts, the man holds his a large mechanical looking scythe out to her. Has an hour glass symbol carved into the blade. The hour glass glows. Catherine appears healed, tries to stand but collapses.
