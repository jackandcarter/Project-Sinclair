[2024-05-31 19:27:51] RxDrStocks: Four attendants start out with Saint Clarice.  1. The most important thing for them is to block any damage Saint Clarice might receive.  2. The one with the highest current hp could always be the one to block damage for her.  3. We want them to be challenging to defeat. The best strategy would be for the player to focus on killing one at a time since Clarice will heal all of the others to full every time one is defeated.  4. They could probably have more health than be damaging since there will be only 2 Holy Knights in this fight. 5. These could be designed after whatever demigod models we use for the mobs, but with white clothing. Each demigod to be one of the different types of already made demigod mobs. Will describe this more in enemy and boss moves.
